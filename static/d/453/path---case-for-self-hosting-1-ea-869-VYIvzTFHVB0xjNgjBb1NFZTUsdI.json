The content that <strong>we</strong> created was pilfered from our control, peddled to the highest bidder, and plastered in advertisements. Anything that didn’t titillate, tickle or trigger was quickly hidden by algorithmic <em>feeds</em> and <em>timelines</em>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)\">2012</a>, while all this content commercialism was steaming along, a little startup called <strong>Medium</strong> was born. It offered a simple interface and slick experience for writer and reader alike.</p>\n<p>When I discovered it in 2014, I was enamoured. After attempting to build my own blogging platform which coincidentally, also launched in 2012, (without success) I saw what I might have achieved with a bit more experience, knowledge and luck.</p>\n<p>To many people, Medium seemed like a viable escape from the grip of content killers. Without the effort of coding it yourself, hosting and managing wordpress or whatever else. Medium was cool, man. And you could be cool too.</p>\n<p>But of course, it was not to last. As I have come to learn, the cool kids are never <em>really</em> your friends. Once again, the platform bloated and profits became the goal at the expense of user experience. Now, practically every article on the homepage is a <em>“member feature story”</em>, costing you $5 a month to read. (The first 3 are free, yipee!)</p>\n<p>But whatever, right? I am not my platform. My articles are still free. I can survive.</p>\n<p>Well, through-platform discovery is next to useless. About 99% of my traffic comes from Twitter, Reddit and occasionally Hacker News. That’s no way to build an audience.</p>\n<p>And I’m not the only one to identify that. In 2019, many writers are <a href=\"https://www.joshjahans.com/ditching-medium/\">losing faith</a> in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19034676\">third party</a> <a href=\"https://write.as/blog/ending-our-medium-integration\">services</a>.</p>\n<h2>Everything Old is New Again.</h2>\n<p>This all leads back to the start.</p>\n<p>Hosting used to be expensive, unreliable and complicated. Now, with services like <a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com\">bluehost</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/wordpress/\">dreamhost</a> and even <a href=\"https://namecheap.com\">namecheap</a> offering out-of-the-box wordpress, hosting your own content is easier and cheaper than ever.</p>\n<p>For those with tech chops, <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">github pages</a> offers completely free static hosting. That, in combination with a static site generator like <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\">gatsby</a> or <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">hugo</a> gives you the ultimate in flexibility and efficiency without sacrificing control of your content.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the tools available to independent bloggers / writers have (sort of<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>) caught up with platforms that no longer offer meaningful features.</p>\n<h2>The catch</h2>\n<p>This all sounds great, but people moved to third party platforms for a reason. So what are we missing out on?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Discovery</strong> is up to you. Platforms don’t do much, but they don’t do nothing. If you’re not actively sharing your content and building an audience externally, you may as well be locked in a dark room whispering to yourself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interaction</strong> is difficult. Without the platform to handle user accounts, nobody can leave a comment. “But Wordpress has comments” I hear you moan. Yes. It does. And nobody but bots uses it. You could use a third party service like <a href=\"https://disqus.com/\">disqus</a>, I don’t think usage would be high. Personally, I’m just hoping people will tweet me to discuss.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interaction (Again)</strong> with meaningful light feedback features like ‘like’ and ‘applause’ buttons is impossible without using a third party service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retention</strong> of your readers is going to be tricky. With algorithmic feeds, they will be spoon fed the content they appear to like better. It’s a game you can play to get people coming back. But on a self hosted blog, your only option is a mailing list or other social media / content discovery services, like twitter, reddit etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ab7feca1009979d7db20d11bbc348fc5/08b6c/stats.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 37.051039697542535%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAHCAYAAAAIy204AAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAk0lEQVQoz41RCwrFIAzb/S8qTp2KiJ+pHREUfHtsC4QqtCFNt9Ya1VrpCej5ym08UkoUQqAYY+f4o76JlFJWQcAYQ0IIUkrRvu+9MsZISjld/roGIGatnaI3h+d5/l35CdgIsS2CWuvuzDk3RUfTE4ExswjmnGeG3vvOL0eAEOZuR4FDzjkdx9GzRH27PAAj6B8ZXpwTJ6FAgnLIAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Medium Stats\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ab7feca1009979d7db20d11bbc348fc5/40fad/stats.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ab7feca1009979d7db20d11bbc348fc5/707e9/stats.png 148w,\n/static/ab7feca1009979d7db20d11bbc348fc5/649e0/stats.png 295w,\n/static/ab7feca1009979d7db20d11bbc348fc5/40fad/stats.png 590w,\n/static/ab7feca1009979d7db20d11bbc348fc5/b3fef/stats.png 885w,\n/static/ab7feca1009979d7db20d11bbc348fc5/08b6c/stats.png 1058w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>This is one of my more popular posts from last year.

It works kind of like Facebook’s <em>like</em> button, except you can click it multiple times. It’s dead simple, and it improves the user experience for everybody:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The author gets clear, purposeful feedback on their content.</li>\n<li>The reader gets a fun and flexible way to interact with the post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./image1.png\" alt=\"Applause in action\">\n<em>Applause in action…barely</em></p>\n<p>The value of allowing readers to click it multiple times is clear as soon as you read something you <em>really</em> like. Click 10 times, and all of a sudden you feel empowered. Expressing the scale of your enjoyment goes  along way. It really does feel like applauding.</p>\n<h2>What about self hosted blogs?</h2>\n<p>“You’re a web developer” I hear you say “Why don’t you build your own, I mean it’s just a button right?”</p>\n<p>Not quite. An applause button requires 2 features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Storing the number of clicks</li>\n<li>Identifying who has clicked</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 1 is much easier than step 2, but even still, it requires some form of persistent data storage like an SQL database. Here’s the problem: while many blogsging platforms like wordpress require a database, my blog (and many others like it) is static. There is no database. It’s not quite plain old HTML, but <a href=\"http://gatsbyjs.org\">it’s not far off it</a>.</p>\n<p>Step 2 is even harder. Even if I had a database, there would be no way of telling who is applauding my work, or preventing spammers. I want the number to accurately reflect people’s enjoyment of the post.I want to know who they are. I want to know what other kind of content they are applauding. Maybe they create their own content! Maybe I want to applaud somebody elses content to say: “Hey, I like you what you’re doing here, you’d like what I’m doing!</p>\n<h2>What if…?</h2>\n<p>If you’re in any way tech oriented, you might be thinking: “That sounds a lot like facebooks embedded like and share buttons”. You are correct. Facebook (and others) solved this problem years ago. As a content owner, you copied some javascript into your website and got a facebook ‘like and share’ button on your page. No backend database or difficult implementation necessary.</p>\n<p>Anybody with a facebook account could like your content and it would be linked to their account, and their network of friends. And if your content was connected to facebook, you could see who they were. It was extremely popular, and drove a huge amount of traffic around the web.</p>\n<p>And then it stopped. Embedded ‘like and share’ buttons fell out of fashion some time in the early 2010s. As more and more content was shoved in our faces and timelines became commoditized, there was no longer any value in sharing. Nobody cared anymore.</p>\n<p>Then it became harder and harder to make independent content. If your content wasn’t on Facebook, it may as well has not been online at all. People gradually moved to posting content targetted directly at Facebook. In the bogging world, plaatforms like Medium gained traction promising less hassle and more traffic.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>  An argument could be made that we were all hoodwinked by the Mark Zuckerbergs of this world in this regard.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>  I have many gripes with current blogging tools that I will cover in a later post.
