It works kind of like Facebook’s <em>like</em> button, except you can click it multiple times. It’s dead simple, and it improves the user experience for everybody:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The author gets clear, purposeful feedback on their content.</li>\n<li>The reader gets a fun and flexible way to interact with the post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"&#x27;./image1.png\" alt=\"Applause in action\">\n<em>Applause in action…barely</em></p>\n<p>The value of allowing readers to click it multiple times is clear as soon as you read something you <em>really</em> like. Click 10 times, and all of a sudden you feel empowered. Expressing the scale of your enjoyment goes  along way. It really does feel like applauding.</p>\n<h2>What about self hosted blogs?</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Case for Applause","date":"February 15, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/case-for-applause/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/vivisection-of-opentable-widget/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vivisection of OpenTable widget.","draft":false}},"next":null}}
