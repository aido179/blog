Imagine a super-high-level language that could describe a software application tersely, but still capture the usefulness of the application.</p>\n<h2>✏️ Our app</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yaml\"><pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\">Example 1\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">App</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Twitter\n  Allow user to<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> login\n  Allow user to<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> send a tweet\n  Allow user to<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> follow another user\n  Allow user to<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> view a timeline of tweets</code></pre></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/aido179/1734bb23182d801f4db3b3e694d54a63\"><em>further examples here</em></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our app needs a name, we’ll use Twitter as an example.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">login</code> is pretty self explanatory and so common that we can assume it’s baked into the language. <code class=\"language-text\">login</code> becomes <code class=\"language-text\">library.login</code> indicating we will use provided library behaviour and not a custom implementation.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">send a tweet</code> is a unique instance of a very common action: take some user input (data: text, image, video, audio etc) and store it somewhere (write), so it can be returned (read) later. We can specify all that in more detail later. For now, let’s imagine <code class=\"language-text\">send a tweet</code> just references further configuration somewhere else, and becomes <code class=\"language-text\">custom.tweet</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">follow another user</code> again, a unique name for a common action: make a link, connection or relationship between two things, in this case, users of our app. In the case of twitter, the follower-to-followed relationship is <strong>many-to-one</strong>. The Facebook friend-to-friend relationship is <strong>one-to-one</strong>. On reddit, user-to-subreddit subscriptions are <strong>one-to-many</strong>. <code class=\"language-text\">follow another user</code> becomes <code class=\"language-text\">custom.follow</code></li>\n<li>view a timeline of tweets is a read action. It’s going to get some set of things, arrange them somehow and display them to the user. It will probably have nested actions, like liking, retweeting and replying but we’ll handle that later. It becomes custom.timeline\nOk, let’s iterate.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Applications as Configurations.","date":"January 30, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/applications-as-configurations/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/vivisection-of-opentable-widget/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vivisection of OpenTable widget."}}}}
