Click 10 times, and all of a sudden you feel empowered. Expressing the scale of your enjoyment goes  along way. It really does feel like applauding.</p>\n<h2>What about self hosted blogs?</h2>\n<p>“You’re a web developer” I hear you say “Why don’t you build your own, I mean it’s just a button right?”</p>\n<p>Not quite. An applause button requires 2 features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Storing the number of clicks</li>\n<li>Identifying who has clicked</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 1 is much easier than step 2, but even still, it requires some form of persistent data storage like an SQL database. Here’s the problem: while many blogsging platforms like wordpress require a database, my blog (and many others like it) is static. There is no database. It’s not quite plain old HTML, but <a href=\"http://gatsbyjs.org\">it’s not far off it</a>.</p>\n<p>Step 2 is even harder. Even if I had a database, there would be no way of telling who is applauding my work, or preventing spammers. I want the number to accurately reflect people’s enjoyment of the post.I want to know who they are. I want to know what other kind of content they are applauding. Maybe they create their own content! Maybe I want to applaud somebody elses content to say: “Hey, I like you what you’re doing here, you’d like what I’m doing! </p>\n<h2>What if…?</h2>\n<p>If you’re in any way tech oriented, you might be thinking: “That sounds a lot like facebooks embedded like and share buttons”. You are correct. Facebook (and others) solved this problem years ago. As a content owner, you copied some javascript into your website and got a facebook ‘like and share’ button on your page. No backend database or difficult implementation necessary.</p>\n<p>Anybody with a facebook account could like your content and it would be linked to their account, and their network of friends. And if your content was connected to facebook, you could see who they were. It was extremely popular, and drove a huge amount of traffic around the web. </p>\n<p>And then it stopped. Embedded ‘like and share’ buttons fell out of fashion some time in the early 2010s. As more and more content was shoved in our faces and timelines became commoditized, there was no longer any value in sharing. Nobody cared anymore. </p>\n<p>Then it became harder and harder to make independent content. If your content wasn’t on Facebook, it may as well has not been online at all. People gradually moved to posting content targetted directly at Facebook. In the bogging world, plaatforms like Medium gained traction promising less hassle and more traffic.\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Case for Applause","date":"February 15, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/case-for-applause/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/vivisection-of-opentable-widget/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vivisection of OpenTable widget.","draft":false}},"next":null}}
